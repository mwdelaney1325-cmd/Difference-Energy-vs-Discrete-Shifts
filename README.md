# Difference-Energy-vs-Discrete-Shifts
A single-domain token formalizing difference-energy operators versus discrete shift sampling, with strict packaging discipline.
# Difference-Energy vs Discrete Shifts

Status: Token-legal / Single-domain / Single-track  
Purpose: Packaging cleanup only — no new equilibria  
Scope: Mechanically usable object; future-compatible

---------------------------------------------------------------------

STANDING DOMAIN CONDITION

Domain: puppy.

All objects, operators, transforms, invariants, and failures are evaluated
strictly within puppy. No appeals upward. No external repair. No “global”.
No readouts. No imports.

We take as already established inside puppy:

    Euclid-unit 1 ≡ δ := 169/603

This is a unit choice, not a result.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

[0] UNIT / GAP GRID  
(orientation only — descriptive, not axiomatic)

Define the puppy unit:

    δ := 169/603

Define observed gap quanta (angle-grid family):

    g_120 := 1/120
    g_90  := 1/90
    g_60  := 1/60

Orientation facts (descriptive only):

    γ/2 ≈ δ + g_120
    γ   ≈ 2δ + g_60

Interpretation inside puppy:

    unit + gap-mass orientation
    no hunt for “1”
